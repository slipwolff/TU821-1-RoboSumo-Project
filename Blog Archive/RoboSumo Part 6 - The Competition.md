Today is the big day, it is the day of the RoboSumo competition as well as the final day of the TU805 RoboSumo Project.

## Pre competition preparations

> *"If it fits, it flies"*â€”Ryanair

Before the robot was able to compete, it had to perform a weigh-in. The following restrictions:
- The Maximum mass is 500 grams.
- Maximum dimensions are 150x150x150 mm.
- None of the parts of the robot should fall out when inverted.

For the weigh-in, we passed the dimensions and the inversion test. With the weight test, we have managed to get the mass to be equal to 499.1 grams, which is right on the spot for the robot to be almost non-compliant. With the weigh-in out of the way, we could proceed with the competition.
The following videos are all credited to Conor as he collected all the footage from the tournament. Unfortunately, the position of the robot starter does not really allow you to collect your own footage, so I got his permission to post it on my blog.

## Friendly bouts, the best way to test the robot before the actual competition
Before the proper competition, we have decided to do a few friendly bouts with friends from other teams. One such bout can be seen here:

We have quickly come to realise that the IR sensors were too sensitive, and the track would interfere with them quite often. We have decided to decrease the sensitivity of the sensors by increasing the trip value from 512 to 700. This improved the behaviour on the track quite considerably.

## Bout 1: Win

The first bout was a success, although the robot froze at the end of the track, which resulted in not pushing the opponent off fully.

## Bout 2: Lose

Our second bout was a loss. Unfortunately, the opponent had a better scoop than us. However, overall we have got 4th place in our group, which qualified us for the quarter-finals.

## Quarter Finals
The quarter-finals were run on a best of 3 basis. For the first attempt, we had a massive win.

The second round was a draw due to a technical mishap in both robots...

Both robots were not able to see each other so there was no clear winner.

However, the third and an extra tiebreaker attempts were a resounding loss for our robot.

Overall, we achieved a 7th place in the competition, which, in my opinion, was quite an achievement for an in-house competition.

## Wait. There is more
At the end of the day, a Royal rumble was held. For this part of the competition, all the robots were put in a large arena and fought with each other until there was only one left standing.

Unfortunately our robot fell out quite early, but still it was a fun thing to try.

## The end
Overall, I have enjoyed the 12 weeks I was doing this project. Throughout this project, I did definitely learn a lot of new things, and expanded my already established knowledge in electronics. My favourite part of this entire project was building the custom circuit board and programming the microcontroller on the board. If I was to repeat this project, I would definitely implement improvements to the design Conor, JR and I have made. I have also enjoyed working with this team as even though I believe I am a hard person to work with, we were able to get along with each other, and we have successfully completed the project together as a group. Without them, if I was to do it all individually, I would have possibly overloaded myself and lost all motivation to do this project. I would also like to thank all the lecturers that put the project together as this module was really enjoyable and helped in developing my skills.
