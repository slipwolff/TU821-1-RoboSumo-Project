While I was doing finishing touches on the electronics, due to the fact that some components that were not really needed but were nice to have arrived the day before, I have delegated the assembly job to Conor and JR. Nevertheless, I will still cover my point of view and the method of assembly in this brief article.
All images are accredited to Conor and JR, who did the assembly during the time I was working with the electronics.

## Phase 1: Putting the shell together
For the first part, the sidewalls were glued to the baseplate. Hot glue was used for this part.

## Phase 2: Inserting the electronics, and the roof
As the glue had finished cooling, I had the electronics completed, and we were able to put them in next. Overall, everything was going really well up to this point.

And here is a closeup of the circuit board:

And finally we put the top on the robot. It was decided to duct tape the top to the body of the robot to allow for easy maintenance if such a need arises.

## Testing the robot
We have decided to test the sensors on the robot before the day by covering all the sensors with our hands and using a book to test the HC-SR04 sensor.
Here I have linked a video uploaded by Conor (used with his permission) showing us testing the robot:

## Conclusion
With the robot ready to go, it was ready for the competition. In the next and final article, I will cover the competition. Till then, enjoy your day.
